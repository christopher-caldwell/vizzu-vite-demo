# Vizzu Chart Demo with Vite

This demo works, but could be better. The wasm file needs to be copied to the public folder, but this is a small cost ( to me ).

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository, or use the green "Use as a template" button on the top right.

Run `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies. There is a `postinstall` script that will copy the `wasm` file to the proper directory. It's part of version control, but this is done to ensure that you have the latest version should you upgrade Vizzu versions.

## Running

To run the app, use `yarn dev`. It's the bare bones basic chart, but a good start.
