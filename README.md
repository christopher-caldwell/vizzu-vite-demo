# Vizzu Chart Demo with Vite

This demo works.

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository, or use the green "Use as a template" button on the top right.

Run `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies.

## Running

To run the app, use `yarn dev`. It's the bare bones basic chart, but a good start.
